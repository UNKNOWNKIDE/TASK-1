 # Caesar Cipher 

Overview : 
The Caesar Cipher GUI Application is a Python-based tool that enables users to encrypt or decrypt text using the Caesar cipher technique. The graphical user interface (GUI) simplifies the process, making it accessible to both technical and non-technical users.The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. This application provides options to customize the shift value and select between encryption and decryption modes.

## Features
**User-Friendly GUI:**

  - Simple and intuitive design for entering text and selecting options

**Encryption & Decryption:**

  - Supports both modes of the Caesar cipher
    
**Custom Shift Value:**

  - Allows users to define the number of positions to shift the alphabet
    
**Preserves Non-Alphabet Characters:**

  - Non-alphabetic characters (e.g., punctuation, spaces) remain unchanged
    
**Instant Results:**

  - Displays the processed result immediately upon clicking the "Process" button
    
**Error Handling:**

  - Provides clear error messages for invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer shift values)
    
## Requirements

  - >**Python: Version 3.6 or higher**
  - >**Tkinter: Comes pre-installed with Python (for GUI functionality)**

## Installation

1.Ensure Python is installed on your system
    
  - You can download Python from python.org.
         
Clone or download this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/caesar-cipher-gui.git
cd caesar-cipher-gui
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
python caesar_cipher_gui.py
```
## Usage
 - Launch the application by running the script.
 - Enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt in the "Enter Text" field. 
 - Specify the shift value in the "Enter Shift" field.
**Select the mode:**
 - "Encrypt" for encryption.
 - "Decrypt" for decryption.
 - Click the "Process" button to generate the result.
 - View the result in the "Result" label.
